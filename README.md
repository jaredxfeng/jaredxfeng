## This is Jared Feng ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am the chef and the bottle washer around here. 

## Work
I work full-time in the Data Science & Optimization team of [Energy Toolbase](https://energytoolbase.com)! Exciting stuff always happens at work.

## On the side
I'm learning web/full stack development for use cases like personal websites/blogs and CRUD applications. I am an avaricious reader. I seasonally teach theology classes at [my church](https://firstbaptistcalgary.com). 

## Not on the side
Theological convictions: Christian, Reformed, Calvinistic, Baptist, and eschatologically optimistic.
