## This is Jared Feng ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am the chef and the bottle washer around here. 

## Work
I work full-time in the Data Science & Optimization team of [Energy Toolbase](https://energytoolbase.com). Exciting stuff always happens at work.

## On the side
- I'm learning web/full stack development for use cases like personal websites/blogs and CRUD applications.
- I am an avaricious reader, and I enjoy works from [Douglas Wilson](https://dougwils.com) and [G.K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton) the most.
- I seasonally teach theology classes at [First Baptist Calgary](https://firstbaptistcalgary.com). I also run social media accounts, create graphics and posts, and run the bookstore at the church.
- I love having honest conversations about the Christian faith, and would like to grow in Christian apologetics.
- I currently train to get faster at running 5K.

## Not on the side
Theological convictions: Christian, Reformed, Baptist, and eschatologically optimistic. I affirm the Apostles Creed, the Nicene Creed (325 A.D.), the Athanasian Creed, and I affirm the [1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith](https://www.the1689confession.com/).
