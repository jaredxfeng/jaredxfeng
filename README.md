Psalm 3:1 O LORD, how many are my foes!
    Many are rising against me;
    
2 many are saying of my soul,
    ‚ÄúThere is no salvation for him in God.‚Äù _Selah_

3 But you, O LORD, are a shield about me,
    my glory, and the lifter of my head.
    
4 I cried aloud to the LORD,
    and he answered me from his holy hill. _Selah_

5 I lay down and slept;
    I woke again, for the Lord sustained me.
    
6 I will not be afraid of many thousands of people
    who have set themselves against me all around.

7 Arise, O LORD!
    Save me, O my God!
For you strike all my enemies on the cheek;
    you break the teeth of the wicked.

8 Salvation belongs to the LORD;
    your blessing be on your people! _Selah_
